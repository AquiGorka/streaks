## Dev

Spin up the server:

```sh
cd server
npm i
npm run dev
```

Then the UI:

```sh
cd ui
npm i
npm start
```

and open up `http://localhost:3003`

### Fake login

Auth was out-of-scope for this project, but a fake login was implemented. Provide a user id and a display name, if you refresh or log out and come back the data will persist.
